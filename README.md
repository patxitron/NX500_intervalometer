# Intervalometer with web interface for Samsung NX500.

This app is for installing into the camera.

See https://github.com/ottokiksmaler/nx500_nx1_modding

It uses buildroot to make a modern toolchain with C++11 support capable to
cross-compile to the camera OS. The final binary is statically linked so no
libraries must be installed on camera.
